## Primary Techniques

### 1. Mind Mapping

### 2. SCAMPER Method

**How it works:**
- **S**ubstitute - What can be substituted?
- **C**ombine - What can be combined?

- **R**everse - What can be rearranged/reversed?

### 3. "How Might We" (HMW)

**Example:** "Users abandon signup" â†’ "How might we make signup more engaging?"

### 4. Rapid Ideation
**When to use:** Generating large volume of concepts quickly

**Best for:** Breaking through creative blocks, exploring all possibilities

### 5. Starbursting (5W2H)

**Best for:** Requirements gathering, ensuring nothing is missed

### 6. 5 Whys

**How it works:** Ask "why" five times to dig deeper into underlying issues
**Best for:** Understanding real business problems behind requests

## SaaS-Specific Applications

### Feature Analogy Technique
Compare your feature to familiar tools/concepts to spark new ideas
**Example:** "Like a Swiss Army knife for data analysis"

### Customer-Centric Brainstorming
Always include customer feedback and pain points in ideation sessions

### Brainwriting vs Group Brainstorming
Individual idea generation often produces more diverse, original concepts than group sessions
