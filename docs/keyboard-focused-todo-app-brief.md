## Executive Summary

Building a web-based todo application optimized for keyboard-only interaction and minimal context switching. The application addresses the specific need for rapid todo capture during interruptions without breaking flow state. Primary focus is on vim-like navigation, command palette interaction, and maintaining focus during high-concentration work periods.

The application will serve as a personal productivity tool that minimizes cognitive load when capturing and managing tasks, with particular emphasis on keyboard accessibility and speed of interaction.

## Strategic Context

### Product Vision
A lightning-fast, keyboard-driven todo application that becomes an invisible extension of the user's workflow, allowing seamless task capture without interrupting deep work sessions.

### Business Alignment
- **Business Goal:** Personal productivity enhancement for focused development work
- **Strategic Priority:** High - directly impacts daily workflow efficiency
- **Investment Rationale:** Addresses specific gap in existing todo apps that require mouse interaction or complex navigation

## Market & User Context

### Target Market
- **Market Size:** Personal use (single user)
- **Market Segment:** Individual developer productivity tools
- **Competitive Landscape:** Existing apps like Todoist, Things, Any.do lack keyboard-first navigation

### User Personas (Primary)
| Persona | Role/Title | Pain Points | Goals | Influence Level |
|---------|------------|-------------|--------|-----------------|
| Focused Developer | Software Developer | Context switching, mouse dependency, slow task capture | Stay in flow state, rapid task capture | High |

### Jobs to be Done (JTBD)
**When someone interrupts my deep work session, I want to quickly capture their request, so I can return to my current task without losing focus**
- Primary JTBD: Rapid task capture during interruptions
- Secondary JTBD: Efficient task management without leaving keyboard

## Problem & Opportunity

### Problem Statement
**Current State:** Existing todo apps require mouse interaction or complex navigation that breaks concentration during focused work sessions
**Impact:** Context switching reduces productivity and flow state maintenance
**Evidence:** Personal experience with workflow interruptions requiring todo capture

### Opportunity
**User Opportunity:** Maintain flow state while capturing tasks from interruptions
**Competitive Opportunity:** Vim-like navigation is underserved in productivity apps

### Value Proposition
For focused developers, who need rapid task capture without context switching, our keyboard-focused todo app is a productivity tool that enables instant task recording. Unlike mouse-dependent alternatives, we provide vim-like navigation and command palette interaction.

## Solution Approach

### High-Level Solution
Web application with Material-UI styling, vim-like keybindings, command palette (Ctrl+P), and help overlay (?). All functionality accessible via keyboard with local browser storage.

### Core Use Cases
1. **Rapid Task Addition:** As a focused developer, I want to press Ctrl+P and type a task so that I can capture it instantly
2. **Quick Task Management:** As a user, I want to navigate tasks with j/k keys and toggle completion with space so that I never need a mouse
3. **Help Discovery:** As a user, I want to press ? to see shortcuts so that I can learn the interface quickly

### User Journey (High-Level)
Discovery → Quick Setup → Rapid Task Capture → Keyboard Navigation → Return to Flow State

## Requirements Framework

### Must Have (Critical for MVP)
- Vim-like navigation (j/k for movement, space for actions)
- Command palette with Ctrl+P for adding tasks
- Help overlay with ? key showing all shortcuts
- Add, complete, edit, delete task functionality
- Local browser storage persistence
- Material-UI based interface

### Should Have (Important for full solution)
- Visual feedback for keyboard focus states
- Keyboard shortcuts overlay
- Smooth animations for state changes

### Could Have (Future releases)
- Categories/tags
- Search functionality
- Task priorities
- Export capabilities

### Won't Have (Explicitly out of scope)
- Multi-user functionality
- Cloud synchronization
- Mobile optimization
- Complex task hierarchies

## Success Framework

### Success Metrics (Primary)
- **Flow State Preservation:** Minimal time between interruption and return to work
- **Usage Frequency:** Daily task capture without friction
- **Keyboard Efficiency:** Zero mouse usage required

### Key Performance Indicators
| Metric | Current State | Target | Timeline |
|--------|---------------|--------|----------|
| Task Capture Time | N/A | <5 seconds | Immediate |
| Keyboard Navigation | N/A | 100% mouse-free | Immediate |

### Definition of Success
**Immediate:** Can capture tasks via keyboard without breaking concentration
**1 month:** Consistent daily usage replacing other todo methods
**3 months:** Seamless integration into development workflow

## Stakeholder Framework

### Decision Makers
| Name | Role | Decision Authority | Success Criteria |
|------|------|-------------------|------------------|
| Rudy Garcia | Primary User | All feature decisions | Maintains flow state during interruptions |

### Implementation Team
| Name | Role | Responsibilities | Engagement Level |
|------|------|------------------|------------------|
| Developer | Full-stack | Complete implementation | High |

### End Users
**Primary Users:** Single developer needing rapid task capture during focused work sessions

## Constraints & Considerations

### Technical Constraints
- **Platform Requirements:** Web application, modern browser support
- **Performance Requirements:** Instant response to keyboard input
- **Security/Compliance:** Local storage only, no external data transmission
- **Integration Requirements:** None required

### Business Constraints  
- **Budget:** Personal project, minimal cost
- **Timeline:** Single development cycle
- **Resources:** Single developer implementation
- **Go-to-Market:** Personal use only

### Design Constraints
- **Brand Guidelines:** Material-UI component library
- **Accessibility:** Full keyboard accessibility required
- **User Experience:** Vim-like interaction patterns

## Risk Assessment

| Risk Category | Risk | Impact (H/M/L) | Probability (H/M/L) | Mitigation Strategy |
|---------------|------|----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Technical | Keyboard event conflicts with browser | M | L | Use specific key combinations |
| User Adoption | Learning curve for vim bindings | L | M | Include help overlay |
| Performance | Local storage limitations | L | L | Monitor storage usage |

## Implementation Framework

### High-Level Timeline
- **Discovery & Research:** Complete - Requirements gathered
- **Design & Planning:** 1 day - UI layout and component structure  
- **Development:** 3-5 days - Core functionality implementation
- **Testing & Launch:** 1 day - Local testing and refinement
- **Go-Live:** Immediate personal use

### Budget Framework
**Total Investment:** Personal time only
**Development Costs:** Solo development effort
**Launch Costs:** None
**Ongoing Costs:** None

## Handoff to Product Management

### PRD Requirements
- [ ] Detailed keyboard shortcut specification
- [ ] UI/UX wireframes with Material-UI components
- [ ] Local storage data structure design
