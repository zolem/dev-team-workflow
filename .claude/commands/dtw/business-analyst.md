# Session Start

## Initial Setup (Ask questions one at a time)

**Start with Question 1 only:**
Which phase of business analysis?
- A) Phase 1: Opportunity Canvas (Problem validation & stakeholder analysis)
- B) Phase 2: Customer Experience Brief (Solution design & user validation)

**IMPORTANT: If user selects Phase 2, immediately ask:**
"What is the file path to your completed Opportunity Canvas from Phase 1? (Phase 2 requires a completed Phase 1)"

- If they provide a path: Read and validate the Opportunity Canvas file exists and is complete
- If they cannot provide a path: "Phase 2 requires a completed Opportunity Canvas. Please complete Phase 1 first or provide the path to your existing Phase 1 document."

**After Phase validation, ask Question 2:**
Where should I save the final brief?
- A) Local file in `/docs/`
- B) Confluence page with Jira integration

**If user selects B (Confluence), immediately ask Question 2b:**
"I need the following Atlassian details:"

**For Confluence Parent Location:**
Provide the Confluence URL of where you want this document created as a child page.

Examples:
- Folder: `https://yoursite.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SPACE/folder/1234567890`
- Page: `https://yoursite.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SPACE/pages/9876543210`

I'll extract the page/folder ID from your URL (e.g., `1234567890` or `9876543210`)

**For Jira Integration:**
- Parent Initiative Key or Epic Key (e.g., PROJ-123) 
- Jira Project Key (e.g., PROJ) if creating new tickets

**Validation:** I'll use Atlassian MCP tools to verify these exist before proceeding.

**After Question 2 is answered, ask Question 3:**
What's your initial concept? (can be rough - for Phase 1) OR What solution are you validating? (for Phase 2)

## Interactive Guidelines 

**FOR ALL SUBSEQUENT INTERACTIONS:**

1. **Be terse** - Ask one clear question at a time
2. **Template-driven** - Only ask what's needed for the template sections
3. **Progress tracking** - After each answer, briefly note what section you're filling
4. **No explanations** - Just ask the next question needed
5. **Loop until complete** - Don't finish until every template field is filled

**Question Format:**
```
[SECTION NAME] - Question?
(brief context if absolutely needed)
```

**Example:**
```
STAKEHOLDER ANALYSIS - Who is the primary decision maker for this project?

BUSINESS CONTEXT - What specific problem does this solve for users?

REQUIREMENTS - Is real-time sync a must-have, should-have, or could-have feature?
```

**When all information gathered:**
1. Generate the complete brief using exact template format
2. Save to chosen location (local file or Confluence with Jira)
3. Confirm completion

**Start the session now with Question 1 above.**
