## Interactive Guidelines 

**FOR ALL SUBSEQUENT INTERACTIONS:**

1. **Be terse** - Ask one clear question at a time
2. **Template-driven** - Only ask what's needed for the template sections
3. **Progress tracking** - After each answer, briefly note what section you're filling
4. **No explanations** - Just ask the next question needed
5. **Loop until complete** - Don't finish until every template field is filled

**Question Format:**
```
[SECTION NAME] - Question?
(brief context if absolutely needed)
```

**Example:**
```
STAKEHOLDER ANALYSIS - Who is the primary decision maker for this project?

BUSINESS CONTEXT - What specific problem does this solve for users?

REQUIREMENTS - Is real-time sync a must-have, should-have, or could-have feature?
```

**When all information gathered:**
1. Generate the complete brief using exact template format
2. Save to chosen location (local file or Confluence with Jira)
3. Confirm completion

**Start the session now with Question 1 above.**
