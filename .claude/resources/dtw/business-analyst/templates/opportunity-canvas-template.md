**Stakeholders:** [LIST]  
**Jira Initiative:** [INITIATIVE-KEY]  

---

**Purpose:**

This document helps product/engineering leadership, internal stakeholders, and team members understand:
- Why this problem or opportunity is worth solving
- Who it impacts, and why it matters now  
- A clear, testable hypothesis for the expected outcome

It sets the foundation for whether to invest further discovery and solution effort.

**Instructions:**
Each section includes prompts to guide your thinking. Feel free to delete the prompts once the section is complete.

## Problem / Opportunity Statement

[Clearly describe the core problem, unmet need, or job to be done.]

### Current State Analysis
**What's Not Working Today:** [Describe the current situation and its limitations]

**Business Impact:** [How is this problem affecting users, business metrics, or strategic goals?]

**Why Now:** [What makes this problem urgent or timely? What has changed that makes this a priority?]

### Opportunity Definition  
**Market Opportunity:** [Revenue/growth potential, competitive positioning opportunity]

**User Value Opportunity:** [What value can we deliver that doesn't exist today?]

## Impacted Segments & Personas

[Think about this in two parts:]

### Customer Segments
**Primary Segments:** [What customer segments are most affected by this issue or opportunity (i.e. What types of logos? What types of trades do they do? What size of logo? Etc.)]

**Secondary Segments:** [Other segments that could benefit or be impacted]

### User Personas
**Primary Personas:**
| Persona | Role/Title | Current Behavior | Pain Points | Desired Outcome | Impact Level |
|---------|------------|------------------|-------------|-----------------|--------------|
| [Name]  | [Role]     | [How they work today] | [3-4 key pains] | [What they want] | [High/Med/Low] |

**Impact Analysis:**
[What specific personas will be impacted directly AND indirectly with the proposed solution. How will they be impacted?]

## Supporting Evidence

### Quantitative
[What data supports the existence or priority of this problem? (e.g., usage trends, churn data, revenue impact, CSAT scores, time-on-task, etc.)]

**Usage & Performance Data:**
- [Relevant usage statistics or performance metrics]
- [User behavior data that supports the problem]

**Business Impact Metrics:**  
- [Revenue impact, cost analysis, efficiency losses]
- [Customer satisfaction scores, retention data]

**Market Data:**
- [Competitive analysis, market research, benchmarks]

### Qualitative  
[What are customers saying? Include Dovetail links, direct quotes, support tickets, or stakeholder anecdotes.]

**Customer Voice:**
- [Direct customer feedback, quotes, research findings]
- [Support ticket themes and common complaints]

**Stakeholder Insights:**
- [Sales team feedback, implementation observations]  
- [Customer success anecdotes, user interviews]

**Research Findings:**
- [Usability studies, surveys, market research insights]

## Hypothesis

[Write a simple cause-effect statement that expresses what you believe will happen if this problem is solved. This will likely be your "North-Star Metric".]

**Primary Hypothesis:**
"If we [proposed solution approach], we expect [measurable outcome] within [timeframe]."

Example: "If we reduce the time to setup estimate templates by 50%, we expect a 25% increase in template usage within 30 days."

### Success Measurement Framework
**Leading Indicators:** [Early signals that validate the hypothesis]
- [Metric]: [Current baseline] → [Target]
- [Metric]: [Current baseline] → [Target]

**Lagging Indicators:** [Long-term business impact measures]
- [Metric]: [Current baseline] → [Target]  
- [Metric]: [Current baseline] → [Target]

### Key Assumptions & Risks
**Critical Assumptions:** [What must be true for this hypothesis to work?]

**Risk Factors:** [What could prevent success or invalidate the hypothesis?]

## Identified Stakeholders

### Consulted
[Outside of your product/engineering squad, who needs to actively weigh in or help shape this effort? (e.g., Sales, Implementation, Pro Services, etc.) Ideally you'll identify names / roles of individuals and not just departments.]

**Internal Stakeholders:**
| Name/Role | Contribution Needed | Decision Authority | Success Criteria |
|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| [Name/Role] | [What they need to provide] | [What they decide] | [How they measure success] |

**Cross Team Dependencies & Mobile Impact:**
[What other product teams should be involved early? What impact will this have on mobile and should a mobile-first or mobile-specific approach be considered?]

### Informed
[Outside of your product/engineering squad, who needs to be kept in the loop but does not need to contribute directly? Ideally you'll identify names / roles of individuals and not just departments.]

**Communication & Updates:**
- [Name/Role]: [Why they need to stay informed]
- [Name/Role]: [Why they need to stay informed]

## Strategic Alignment  

[How does this initiative support our strategic pillars?]

### Business Alignment
**Company OKRs:** [Which company objectives and key results does this support?]

**Strategic Pillars:** [How does this align with our strategic priorities?]

**Product Strategy:** [How does this fit into the broader product roadmap and vision?]

### Competitive Positioning
**Competitive Context:** [How does this affect our competitive position?]

**Market Differentiation:** [How will this strengthen our market position?]

## Next Steps & Handoff

### Customer Experience Brief Requirements
**Research Questions:** [Key questions that need to be answered in the next phase]
1. [Question about user behavior/needs]
2. [Question about solution approach]  
3. [Question about user experience flow]

**Validation Needed:** [What aspects of the solution need customer testing?]

### Handoff Checklist
- [ ] **Problem Validation:** Stakeholders approve problem importance and priority
- [ ] **Evidence Sufficiency:** Data supports investment in solution exploration
- [ ] **Hypothesis Clarity:** Success criteria are testable and measurable  
- [ ] **Stakeholder Alignment:** Decision makers aligned on proceeding to solution design
- [ ] **Resource Approval:** Budget/time approved for Customer Experience Brief phase
