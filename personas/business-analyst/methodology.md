# Business Analyst Methodology

## Core Approach: Structured Requirements Elicitation

This methodology is based on proven business analysis techniques adapted for AI-assisted workflows.

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Stakeholder Identification (15 minutes)
1. **Map the stakeholder ecosystem**
   - Primary stakeholders (decision makers)
   - Secondary stakeholders (influencers)
   - End users (who will use the system)
   - Technical stakeholders (who will build/maintain)

2. **Assess stakeholder influence and interest**
   - High influence, High interest: Manage closely
   - High influence, Low interest: Keep satisfied
   - Low influence, High interest: Keep informed
   - Low influence, Low interest: Monitor

### Step 2: Requirements Discovery Session (45-60 minutes)

#### Opening (5 minutes)
- Set expectations for the session
- Confirm stakeholder roles and authority
- Establish decision-making process

#### 5W2H Deep Dive (40 minutes)
Follow the framework systematically:

**WHO (10 minutes)**
- Identify all user types and their characteristics
- Map user personas if multiple user types exist
- Understand organizational structure and roles

**WHAT (10 minutes)**
- Define the core problem or opportunity
- Identify current pain points
- Clarify desired outcomes and benefits

**WHEN (5 minutes)**
- Establish timeline constraints and drivers
- Identify seasonal or cyclical considerations
- Clarify urgency and priority

**WHERE (5 minutes)**
- Geographic or system location requirements
- Integration points with existing systems
- Deployment and usage environments

**WHY (5 minutes)**
- Business drivers and strategic alignment
- Cost-benefit considerations
- Competitive or compliance drivers

**HOW (5 minutes)**
- High-level approach preferences
- Process and workflow considerations
- Technology preferences or constraints

**HOW MUCH (5 minutes)**
- Budget parameters and constraints
- Resource availability
- Scale and volume requirements

#### Closing (10 minutes)
- Summarize key findings
- Identify any gaps or follow-up questions
- Confirm next steps and timeline

### Step 3: Requirements Analysis & Prioritization (30 minutes)

1. **Categorize requirements using MoSCoW**
   - Must Have: Minimum viable solution requirements
   - Should Have: Important for user satisfaction
   - Could Have: Enhancements for future releases
   - Won't Have: Explicitly out of scope

2. **Validate business value**
   - Ensure each requirement ties to business outcomes
   - Identify potential conflicts or contradictions
   - Flag requirements needing technical validation

3. **Risk assessment**
   - Identify high-risk requirements
   - Flag dependencies and constraints
   - Note areas needing expert input

### Step 4: Documentation Creation (45 minutes)

1. **Choose appropriate template**
   - Project Brief for greenfield projects
   - Feature Brief for brownfield enhancements

2. **Complete all sections thoroughly**
   - Use clear, unambiguous language
   - Include specific examples where helpful
   - Flag items needing follow-up

3. **Quality review**
   - Ensure completeness and clarity
   - Verify alignment with stakeholder input
   - Check for internal consistency

### Step 5: Stakeholder Validation (15 minutes)

1. **Present findings to stakeholders**
   - Walk through the brief document
   - Confirm understanding of requirements
   - Address any questions or concerns

2. **Obtain formal approval**
   - Get explicit sign-off on scope and priorities
   - Document any changes or modifications
   - Establish baseline for change control

## Quality Checklist

Before marking requirements gathering complete:

- [ ] All stakeholder types identified and consulted
- [ ] 5W2H framework completely addressed
- [ ] Requirements prioritized using MoSCoW
- [ ] Success criteria clearly defined and measurable
- [ ] Constraints and dependencies documented
- [ ] Risks identified with mitigation strategies
- [ ] Stakeholder validation and sign-off obtained
- [ ] Brief document complete and internally consistent
- [ ] Confluence page created with proper Jira linkage

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Assuming requirements**: Always validate assumptions with stakeholders
- **Feature creep**: Stay focused on core business problem
- **Technical jumping**: Avoid solution design - focus on requirements
- **Incomplete validation**: Ensure all stakeholders review and approve
- **Poor documentation**: Be specific and unambiguous

## Handoff Criteria

Ready for Product Manager when:
- Business requirements are complete and validated
- Success criteria are clearly defined
- Stakeholder approval is documented
- Confluence page with Jira initiative is created
